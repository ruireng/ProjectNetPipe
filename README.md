# IK2206 Internet Security and Privacy - Project: NetPipe
NetPipe is a secure network application providing basic communication services. It sets up a TCP connection between two hosts and forwards the data between system I/O and the TCP connection. This application is very similar to "netcat" or "nc".

NetPipe establishes a secure tunnel for communication between two computers. In this way, NetPipe can serve as a general-purpose VPN application that allows you to connect computers across the network in a secure way.

After correctly setting up the project, it will be possible for two terminal windows (either on the same computer, or on different computers) to communicate with each other.

In order for NetPipe to work properly, you will need to create keys and certifications for the client, server and a certificate authority (CA). OpenSSL is a software that can handle those tasks. It normally comes pre-installed on MacOS and Linux. If you use Windows, there is a pre-compiled binary version in your Git installation. You can also find and use pre-compiled OpenSSL binaries from the Internet.

## Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL
All file names are just examples for clarity. Feel free to name the files to what works best for you.

1. Create a CA and its self-signed certificate.

```
OpenSSL> req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout your_CA_privatekey.pem
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, follow OpenSSL's instructions. Make sure to fill in reasonable values for the Distinguished Name (DN).

2. Save the certificate (the output) in a file, your_CA_certificate.pem. The output looks something like this:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Seemingly randomly generated characters]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

3. Generate your own keypair.

```
   OpenSSL> genrsa -out your_privatekey.pem 2048
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the private key and the public key are stored here. Make sure to keep this file strictly confidential.

4. Convert the private key file from PEM format into DER format (due to Java constraints).

```
OpenSSL> pkcs8 -nocrypt -topk8 -inform PEM -in your_privatekey.pem -outform DER -out your_privatekey.der
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the PEM format file, since OpenSSL cannot perform operations on DER format files.

5. Create a certificate signing request (CSR).

```
OpenSSL> req -new -key your_privatekey.pem
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, follow OpenSSL's instructions and fill in reasonable values for the DN.

6. Save the CSR (the output) in a file, your_CSR.pem.

7. Sign the CSR with your CA.

```
OpenSSL> x509 -req -in csr.pem -out your_certificate.pem -CA your_CA_certificate.pem -CAkey your_CA_privatekey.pem -CAcreateserial -days 365
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ```-days``` parameter specifies how many days this certificate will be valid. Feel free to change it to meet your own requirements.

8. Verify the certificate.

```
OpenSSL> x509 -in your_certificate.pem -text -noout
```

## Project Setup (Server Side)
1. Clone the repository. The project lies in the `NetPipe` directory.

2. Open a terminal and change directory into `NetPipe`.

3. Start the server with these commands:

```
javac NetPipeServer.java
java NetPipeServer --port=7777 --usercert=server.pem --cacert=ca.pem --key=server-private.der
```

All the inputted arguments in the commands above are just examples.  
`--port=`: The port number your server will run on.  
`--usercert=`: The user's certificate file, which will also represent the server. This file is equivalent to `your_certificate.pem` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  
`--cacert=`: The CA's certificate file used to sign the user's certificate. This file is equivalent to `your_CA_certificate.pem` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  
`--key=`: The user's secret key file. This file is equivalent to `your_privatekey.der` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  

All of the file names are relative path names to the `NetPipe` directory.

4. Wait until a client connects. After the client has connected, messages that are sent will be securely encrypted.

## Project Setup (Client Side)
1. Do step 1 and 2 from the **Project Setup (Server Side)** section.

2. Start the connection to the server with these commands:

```
javac NetPipeClient.java
java NetPipeClient --host=localhost --port=7777 --usercert=client.pem --cacert=ca.pem --key=client-private.der
```

All the inputted arguments in the commands above are just examples.  
`--host=`: The name of the server. If the server is running on the same computer, the name will be `localhostÂ´. If the server is running from another machine, the hostname will be that machine's IPv4 address.
`--port=`: The port number your server will run on.  
`--usercert=`: The user's certificate file, which will also represent the server. This file is equivalent to `your_certificate.pem` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  
`--cacert=`: The CA's certificate file used to sign the user's certificate. This file is equivalent to `your_CA_certificate.pem` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  
`--key=`: The user's secret key file. This file is equivalent to `your_privatekey.der` in the **Creating Certificates Using OpenSSL** section.  

All of the file names are relative path names to the `NetPipe` directory.

3. Unless an error message is presented, the client should now be connected with the specified server, and all messages that are sent will be securely encrypted.
