# IK2206 Internet Security and Privacy - Project: NetPipe
NetPipe is a secure network application providing basic communication services. It sets up a TCP connection between two hosts and forwards the data between system I/O and the TCP connection. This application is very similar to "netcat" or "nc".

NetPipe establishes a secure tunnel for communication between two computers. In this way, NetPipe can serve as a general-purpose VPN application that allows you to connect computers across networks in a secure way.
